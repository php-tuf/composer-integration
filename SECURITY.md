## IMPORTANT

This plugin, as well as the [PHP-TUF library](https://github.com/php-tuf/php-tuf) it depends on, is in a pre-release state and is not considered a complete or secure implementation of the TUF framework. Additionally, this plugin requires Composer 2.2 or later, which has not yet been released.

This plugin should currently only be used for testing, development and feedback. *Do NOT use in production for secure downloads!!*

We appreciate any help finding security issues.

Security issues can be disclosed publicly until the first release. If you think you have found a security issue, please:

1. Search the [existing security issues](https://github.com/php-tuf/composer-integration/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+security) to see if the issue is already known.
2. If the issue is not found please [create a new issue](https://github.com/php-tuf/composer-integration/issues/new) and add the "security" label to the issue.
