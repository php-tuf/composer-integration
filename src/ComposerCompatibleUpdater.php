 * Defines an updater that exposes additional information about TUF targets.

 * This class is necessary because, although PHP-TUF normally is responsible for downloading
 * and verifying its targets transparently (using its ::download() method), Composer doesn't
 * really support overriding its HttpDownloader service -- at least, not without some seriously
 * complicated and fragile sorcery. Therefore, this class exists specifically to allow
 * Composer to download its packages and metadata how it wants, while still allowing us to
 * verify and protect those downloads using PHP-TUF.
 *
 * This class should not be used or extended at any time, in any way, by external code. No
 * promise of backwards compatibility is made. You have been warned!
